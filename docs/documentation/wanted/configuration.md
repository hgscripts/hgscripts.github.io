Config.MenuLocation = "topright" --(3)!
```

1. Change the menu theme. You can choose between "native" or "default"
2. Change the menu size. You can choose between:
      - "size-100" 
      - "size-110" 
      - "size-125" 
      - "size-150" 
      - "size-175" 
      - "size-200"
3. Choose the menu position. Examples:
      - "topleft" 
      - "bottomcenter" 
      - "bottomright" 
      - "centerright" 
      - ... 

#### Text
You can easily translate/change the menu's text and icons
```lua
Config.Title = "Wanted Menu"

```

### Translation
You can easily translate/change the notifications
```lua
Config.text1 = "Online Citizens"
Config.text2 = "Click to Send global notification again"
Config.text3 = "no player nearby"
Config.text4 = "This citizen is wanted"
Config.text5 = "This citizen is not wanted"
Config.text6 = "You are not a police officer or you are not in service"
Config.text12 = "You are busted"
Config.text13 = "An npc has spotted you and called the police"
Config.text14 = "Wanted person spotted"
Config.text15 = "Citizen is now wanted"

Config.text17 = "Notification Sent to citizens"
Config.text18 = "This citizen is no longer wanted"

Config.text20 = "Position Marked in Minimap"
```

### Discord webhooks
We provide discord webhook functionality that sends messages to a discord channel when a citizen is wanted/no longer wanted
```lua
Config.wanteddiscord = "" --(1)! 
Config.notwanteddiscord = "" --(2)!
Config.wantedtitle = "Player Wanted"
Config.notwantedtitle = "Player No longer Wanted"
```

1. Set the link of the webhook that sends out "Player WANTED" when a player is wanted.
2.  Set the link of the webhook that sends out "Player No longer WANTED" when a player's wanted status is removed.

### Ped Blacklist
Here you can set the peds who don't report wanted players (Won't spot the player)
You can find ped hashes [here](https://wiki.rage.mp/index.php?title=Peds){:target="_blank"}
```lua
Config.BlacklistedPeds = {

### Notification settings
```lua
Config.Notification = function(message, type) --(1)!
        if Config.Framework == "newesx" or Config.Framework == "oldesx" then
            TriggerEvent("esx:showNotification", message)
        elseif Config.Framework == "newqb" or Config.Framework == "oldqb"  then
            TriggerEvent('QBCore:Notify', message, type, 1500)
        elseif Config.Framework == "custom" then -- (2)!
            SetNotificationTextEntry("STRING")
            AddTextComponentString(message)
            DrawNotification(false, false)
        end
end
```

1. Here you can change the events for notifications.
2.  - Define your own notification event here.
